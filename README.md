## My process

I began by building the core structure and layout with responsive behavior using `clamp()` for scalable typography and spacing. I implemented real-time clock updates and location/timezone detection via the IPBase API. I integrated animations using Framer Motion for a smooth expanding panel and time transitions. For quotes, I used the Ninja API and ensured proper error fallback behavior.

Special attention was paid to accessibility and performance â€” including semantic roles, ARIA attributes, and session caching for IP data.

### Built with
